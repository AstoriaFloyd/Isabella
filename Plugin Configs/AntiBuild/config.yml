# Define your custom message to be displayed when a player tries to interact and is denied permission.
# Standard CraftBukkit color codes are supported. Use "&" plus the color identifier. Red would be "&c". 
# You must start and end the message with the ' symbol or you will break your config.

# Per block break/place permissions.  Set to true to enable.
# Use this to allow a player to only place or break certain blocks.
# You must ensure they do not have antibuild.bypass or they will still bypass this check.
# Example: antibuild.break.1 would allow a player to only break stone and no other blocks.

# Blacklisted items are not allowed to be placed unless the player is given permission antibuild.blacklist
# Make sure to follow the format and don't use tabs or you will get an error.
# Currently only supports item IDs.  This is done for the gain of a faster check against the blacklist.
